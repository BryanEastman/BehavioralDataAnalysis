# BehavioralDataAnalysis
Support files for the O'Reilly book "Behavioral Data Analysis with R and Python" by Florent Buisson.

If you encounter any problem with the code, please raise an issue through GitHub or email me at florent.buisson.oreilly@maskedmails.com, I'll do my best to address it. 

The code scripts for the chapters of the book are in their respective folders. The folder "Exercises and solutions" contains all the exercises for the book. The folder "production code" contains productionalized versions of the main custom functions I have created, which are more robust to errors (but still come as-is, with no guarantee whatsoever).

I'm not sure yet how much readers care about exercises, so I have created a limited number of them. Feel free to email me at the address above or raise a GitHub issue if you'd like more of them.
