# BehavioralDataAnalysis
Support files for the O'Reilly book "Behavioral Data Analysis with R and Python" by Florent Buisson
BEWARE: This is a work in progress, like the book itself, until August 2021.
If you encounter any problem with the code, please raise an issue through GitHub or email me at 
florent.buisson.oreilly@maskedmails.com, I'll do my best to address it. 

The code scripts for the chapters of the book are in their respective folders. The folder "Exercises and solutions" contains all the exercises for the book. The folder "production code" contains productionalized versions of the main custom functions I have created, which are more robust to errors (but still come as-is, with no guarantee whatsoever).
